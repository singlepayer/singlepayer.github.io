## How It Works

A single-payer system would expand Medicare to cover everyone in the United States: private delivery of health care, with patients choosing their providers. Insurance companies would be phased out over five years, with assistance in the transition, in favor of public financing through a single government agency.

All medically-necessary services would be covered, including doctor's visits, hospitalization, preventive care, long-term care, mental health, reproductive health, dental, vision, medical supplies, and prescription drugs. This would be more generous than Canada's system.

## Current Costs

In 2020, according to [CMS](https://www.healthaffairs.org/doi/full/10.1377/hlthaff.2020.00094?journalCode=hlthaff), national health expenditures reached $4.014 trillion, nearly twice as much as the average OECD country. Spending is on track to rise by over 5% annually, reaching [$6 trillion](https://www.cms.gov/Research-Statistics-Data-and-Systems/Statistics-Trends-and-Reports/NationalHealthExpendData/Downloads/ForecastSummary.pdf) by 2027.

Over half of last year's total spending, $2.145 trillion, was from public government sources: Medicare, Medicaid, federal, and state and local. Private health insurance costs were $1.357 trillion and out of pocket costs were $405 billion, combining for nearly 44% of the total.

## Current Problems

A 2018 study found that despite its highest spending, the United States ranks 27th in the world for its levels of health care outcomes. The U.S. has the lowest life expectancy, highest chronic disease burden, and the highest suicide rates among 11 high-income countries, according to the nonprofit research group [Commonwealth Fund](https://www.commonwealthfund.org/publications/issue-briefs/2020/jan/us-health-care-global-perspective-2019). Previous research has found the U.S. has the [highest number](https://www.healthaffairs.org/doi/10.1377/hlthaff.27.1.58) of preventable deaths under the age of 75 compared to other industrialized countries, of which [20-40%](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4584887/) is preventable, according to the CDC.

As of 2019, 28.9 million nonelderly Americans were uninsured, according to a [Kaiser Family Foundation](https://www.kff.org/uninsured/issue-brief/key-facts-about-the-uninsured-population/) report from Nov. 2020, a rate of 10.9 percent. In 2020, an additional 41.1 million people were underinsured, according to the [Commonwealth Fund](https://www.commonwealthfund.org/publications/issue-briefs/2020/aug/looming-crisis-health-coverage-2020-biennial), making up an additional 21.3% of individuals age 19-64. 

In the first half of 2020, [43.4 percent](https://www.commonwealthfund.org/publications/issue-briefs/2020/aug/looming-crisis-health-coverage-2020-biennial) of adults were inadequately insured according to Commonwealth, defined as people who were uninsured at the time of the survey (12.5%), had experienced a coverage gap in the past year (9.5%), or had such high out-of-pocket costs or deductibles relative to their income that they were effectively underinsured (21.3%). One-third of U.S. adults go without recommended care because of costs, according to a [2016 survey](https://www.healthaffairs.org/doi/10.1377/hlthaff.2016.1088).
